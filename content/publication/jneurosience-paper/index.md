abstract: Feedforward and feedback pathways interact in specific dendritic domains
  to enable cognitive functions such as predictive processing and learning. Based
  on axonal projections, hierarchically lower areas are thought to form synapses primarily
  on dendrites in middle cortical layers, whereas higher-order areas are thought to
  target dendrites in layer 1 and in deep layers. However, the extent to which functional
  synapses form in regions of axodendritic overlap has not been extensively studied.
  Here, we use viral tracing in the secondary visual cortex of male mice to map brain-wide
  inputs to thick-tufted layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive
  map of input locations through subcellular optogenetic circuit mapping. We show
  that input pathways target distinct dendritic domains with far greater specificity
  than appears from their axonal branching, often deviating substantially from the
  canonical patterns. Common assumptions regarding the dendrite-level interaction
  of feedforward and feedback inputs may thus need revisiting.
