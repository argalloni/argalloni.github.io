#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a postdoctoral scientist working in the [Milstein Lab](https://milsteinlab.com) at the Center for Advanced Biotechnology & Medicine at Rutgers University. My research covers topics at the intersection of Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on using tools from machine learning to understand how the brain learns and use neuroscience principles to build better neuromorphic computers. 

Broadly I build artificial neural networks with biologically inspired computing elements, such as incorporating separate dendrite-targeting interneuron populations to help networks locally estimate gradients and learn robust representations. I have also used some of the insights from theoretical modelling of dendrite-dependent synaptic plasticity in the brain to inspire new applications of Mott insulator tranisitons in phase change materials (VO2 thin-films). These insight led to the design of analog electronic circits to implement new learning rules on neuromorphic hardware.

I did my PhD work at the [Francis Crick Institute](https://www.crick.ac.uk) and [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk) under supervision of Prof. Ede Rancz, where I uncovered novel properties of dendritic spikes in L5 pyramidal neurons in the visual cortex.
